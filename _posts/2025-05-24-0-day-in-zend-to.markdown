How I found a Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution in Zend.To?

During a penetration testing project, I encountered a target using the [Zend.To](http://zend.to/) file transfer software. Zend.To is an open-source solution developed since 2010, offering a range of features and integration options for secure file sharing.

Initially, I searched for any existing CVEs associated with Zend.To, but found nothing critical reported at the time. Given the lack of public vulnerabilities, I decided to conduct a deeper analysis.

During my research, I came across an unofficial code repository hosted at:

ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/ergosteur/zendto-localized

Although itâ€™s not the official source, I chose to review the codebase for potential security issues.

While analyzing the code, I discovered that the file `NSSDropoff.php` contains two calls to the `exec()` function where file names are passed without proper sanitization (Screenshot-1).

These file names are stored in the `$jkffilelist` variable, which is populated based on the `tmp_name` parameter from file uploads â€” a value that can be manipulated by an attacker (Screenshot-2).

This creates a **command injection** vulnerability, allowing a malicious user to execute arbitrary system commands during the file upload process
